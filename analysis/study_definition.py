Comments on codelists - here is one where SNOMED codes for vaccins are compiled:
https://github.com/opensafely/oral-anticoagulant-covid-outcome/blob/main/codelists/opensafely-influenza-vaccination.csv
QUESTION: What I am not sure is then how do you set up the study to look up the SNOMED code in which data schemas
Although not marked as such codes here look like SNOMED codes:

    '''Gender has to be a variable if we want to do checks on the data (how many are missing or are Female)
    Keeping a possible specification on gender below initially commented out (not a variable)
    By using that one we may be throwing away cases where there has been gender reassignment together with data that may be wrong.
    There seems to be a case for analysing the data for gender after extraction rather than limiting it to Men only'''
    '''Getting to the specification of the population from the list of SNOMED codes for PSA is the trickiest
        A repository that dealt with diagnostics
        https://github.com/opensafely/SRO-pulse-oximetry/blob/master/analysis/study_definition.py
        had the following code snippet

        had_pulse_ox_event_code=patients.with_these_clinical_events(
        pulse_oximetry_codes,
        between=["index_date", "index_date + 1 month"],
        returning="code",
        return_expectations={"category": {
            "ratios": {str(1325191000000108): 0.6, str(1325201000000105): 0.4}}}

        I think it should be possible to define something like a uniform distribution for the ratios in the codes used
        in PSA testing, and this would be OK for test data, and the final distribution of codes in the non-mock data
        would be correct
        QUESTION: What I have still not understood is if the SNOMED codes are going to be searched in every table where
        they may appear
